Batch-wise Student Performance Analysis
Project Overview
This project performs a comparative performance analysis across three specific student batches: AI_ELITE_4, AI_ELITE_6, and AI_ELITE_7. The objective is to evaluate score distributions, identify top and bottom performers, and derive data-driven insights to recommend teaching interventions.

Objective
Compare academic performance across multiple batches.

Visualize score distributions using various statistical plotting techniques.

Identify students requiring additional support (bottom performers) and those excelling (top performers).

Provide a statistical summary (Mean, Median, Std Dev) for each group.

Data Description
The analysis is based on a dataset containing the following fields:

Batch: The identifier for the student group.

User_ID: Unique identifier for each student.

Score: The raw test score (formatted as "X / 7").

Tech Stack
Python: Core programming language.

Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning.

NumPy: Numerical operations.

Matplotlib / Seaborn: Data visualization.

Jupyter Notebook: Interactive development environment.

Key Analysis Steps
Data Cleaning:

Stripped whitespace from column names.

Parsed the Score string (e.g., "6 / 7") into an integer format for calculation.

Descriptive Statistics:

Calculated overall and batch-wise mean, median, and standard deviation.

Visualization:

Histogram: Comparison of student counts per score per batch.

Boxplot: Visualizing quartiles and identifying score spreads.

Violin Plot: Combining boxplots with density estimates to show the distribution shape.

Performance Ranking:

Extracted the Top 5 and Bottom 5 students for each batch to facilitate targeted feedback.

Summary of Findings (Sample Data)
Based on the notebook execution:

Highest Performing Batch: AI_ELITE_7 (Mean: ~5.06)

Lowest Performing Batch: AI_ELITE_4 (Mean: ~3.79)

Score Range: 0 to 7.
